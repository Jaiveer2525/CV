Old Site I built in high school.
Yes the design is intentionally bare, web 1.0 charm (totally not a excuse to be lazy)
I feel like I should at least add a dark mode, but it doesnt fit the aesthetic, also ew interactivity.

Planning on making pages about random stuff here, maybe Vidya or HEMA or somethhing, eh.
